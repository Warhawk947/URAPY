# Introducing URAPY
## What is URAPY?

URAPY stands for **U**ptime **R**obot **API**, but I wanted it to be more cheesy so I switched it to **APY** (Get it? API? APY? Ok...)

URAPY is a basic API wrapper for [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com/), allowing you to control monitors and public status pages via your python terminal!

## How do I use URAPY?
It's actually very simple to use! To install the package, simply type `pip install URAPY`, and you're good!
